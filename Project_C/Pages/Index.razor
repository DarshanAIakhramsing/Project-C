@*Below we see a lot of uses for AuthorizeView, NotAuthorized and Roles. AuthorizeView means everything inside of that tag can only be seen if
    you are logged in, NotAuthorized is what you will see if you access the page without being logged in as any user and the Roles is meant
    only for users with that specific role these roles can be assigned in the database but because we were told
    there would only need to be one admin who can do everything and one organisator who can create sessions*@
